# Danger-Zone


## Getting Started

### 1. Create a Zone Type

Foundational to all zones is the zone type, an entity that defines an effect that can execute within a zone. If a zone is a lava field, the zone type would be a lava bubble or vent of poisonous gas released from that field. Included in the definition of the zone type is the width and height of the effect, in grid units, the macro invoked, the audio played, and any lasting effects either within the zone (i.e. tile) or on the character in the effect area (i.e. active effect).

Access your world's zone type list by navigating to Foundry's 'Configure Settings' > 'Module Settings', locating Danger Zone, and selecting the 'Configure Danger Zone Types' button. Depending on your personalized module settings, you can also access this list by clicking the 'Danger Zone Types' button found in the footer of the Scenes sidebar. 

For detailed information on configuring Zone Types, see the Zone Types Wiki page.

### 2. Add Zone to Scene

Zones are added to scenes. A scene can have one or more zones assigned to it, and each may have a different boundary within the scene. A zone's boundary defines it's area of influence, inside of which tokens may be targetted and effects generated by that zone. 

The zone type, defined in step one, defines how the zone interacts with the scene and the tokens within the zone. The zone itself defines the boundary, the trigger condition that will launch the zone type's effects, and token targeting rules, among other things.

Create and edit zones by accessing the Danger Zone section from within the scene configuration form. The active scene will also display active zones as buttons within the top navigation beside the scene name. Right clicking the button here also launches that zone's configuration page.

For detailed information on configuring zones, see the Zones Wiki page.

### 3. Trigger Zone

The zone's trigger launches the associated zone type's effects. A trigger can be invoked either manually, by clicking on the zones button from within the top navigation of the zone's scene, or automatically, by associating the zone to one of many automated trigger options (e.g. combat round start).

Once triggered, a workflow initiates that performs a set of operations that includes processing any randomized logic included in the zone, calculating likelihoods and weighting, determining effect location and targets, and generating all effects.

For detailed information on triggering a zone, see the Trigger Wiki page.
