# Danger-Zone


## Getting Started

### 1. Create a Zone Type
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22696153/131511482-314d13d4-aaeb-4ef6-9ef9-8be9a2c4f8a9.png"  height="300">
Foundational to all zones is the zone type, an entity that defines an effect that can execute within a zone. If a zone is a lava field, the zone type would be a lava bubble or vent of poisonous gas released from that field. Included in the definition of the zone type is the width and height of the effect, in grid units, the macro invoked, the audio played, and any lasting effects either within the zone (i.e. tile) or on the character in the effect area (i.e. active effect).

Access your world's zone type list by navigating to Foundry's 'Configure Settings' > 'Module Settings', locating Danger Zone, and selecting the 'Configure Danger Zone Types' button. Depending on your personalized module settings, you can also access this list by clicking the 'Danger Zone Types' button found in the footer of the Scenes sidebar. 

For detailed information on configuring Zone Types, see the [Zone Types](../../wiki/Zone-Types)  page.

### 2. Add Zone to Scene
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22696153/131511349-1c85213c-46cf-4a2a-87db-345989b10603.png"  height="400">

Zones are added to scenes. A scene can have one or more zones assigned to it, and each may have a different boundary within the scene. A zone's boundary defines it's area of influence, inside of which tokens may be targetted and effects generated by that zone. 

The zone type, defined in step one, defines how the zone interacts with the scene and the tokens within the zone. The zone itself defines the boundary, the trigger condition that will launch the zone type's effects, and token targeting rules, among other things.

Create and edit zones by accessing the Danger Zone section from within the scene configuration form. The active scene will also display active zones as buttons within the top navigation beside the scene name. Right clicking the button here also launches that zone's configuration page.

For detailed information on configuring zones, see the [Zones](../../wiki/Zones)  page.

### 3. Trigger Zone

The zone's trigger launches the associated zone type's effects. A trigger can be invoked either manually, by clicking on the zones button from within the top navigation of the zone's scene, or automatically, by associating the zone to one of many automated trigger options (e.g. combat round start).

Once triggered, a workflow initiates that performs a set of operations that includes processing any randomized logic included in the zone, calculating likelihoods and weighting, determining effect location and targets, and generating all effects.

For detailed information on triggering a zone, see the [Triggers](../../wiki/Triggers)  page.

## Module Integration
Danger Zone integrates with a series of other Foundary modules in order to provide enhanced effects and token targetting. Below is a list of the module integrations. It is not required to have these modules installed in order for Danger Zone to work. Module-specific settings will not appear in the applicable forms and will not invoke unless that module is installed and active in the world.

### Advanced Macros
If installed, macros generated by a zone type will have arguments passed into them. These are accessible within the 'args' variable (add console.log(args) to your macro to see the arguments that are passed into the macro within your console). See the [Macros Arguments](../../wiki/Macros-Arguments) page for more information on the arguments provided.

### Kandashi's Fluid Canvas
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22696153/131542485-3eb6c663-586a-45d6-95e2-665c9a03c5da.png)
If installed, most of the effects available within Kandashi's Fluid Canvas are made available to select from in the zone type form. Parameter options influence the effect following that module's [API](https://github.com/kandashi/kandashis-fluid-canvas/blob/master/API.md) rules.
* Delay: pause the fluid canvas effect from triggering after the zone triggers for the entered amount of milliseconds.

### Dynamic Effects Using Active Effects
At the current time the active effect on the Zone Type uses the base active effect form. However, if DAE is installed you will gain any benefits from using DAE when the zone type effect is applied to a token.

### Monk's Active Tiles
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22696153/131545430-00864295-b4e9-48c4-a4af-a7e51db301e1.png)
In the event that the zone type creates a lasting effect, if installed, Monk's Active Tiles actions can be added to that tile. The tile triggers will be set to active, without restriction to token, control or amount of triggers per token, and will trigger on enter 100% of the time. Currently there are 2 options:

#### Macros
* Add the selected macro to the lasting effect's tile actions. Other options provided here follow this module's definitions for this action type.

### Sequencer 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22696153/131546705-20c9ac83-8795-4b61-886a-2bcf30e49864.png)
If sequencer is installed, you have access to add temporary effects to the zone type. These begin execution asynchronously before the lasting effect is created and add the selected animations to enhance the visual effect when the zone is triggered. Effects are located at the center of the targetted area. Both the primary and secondary effects have the same settings, but the primary appears above the tokens on the scene and the secondary will appear under the tokens on the scene.
* File: the given file to play. See other available modules, such as JB2A, for ready available animations to use. The primary or secondary effect will not generate unless this is populated.
* Scale: increases or decreases the scale of the animation from that file's default (in decimal multiplier form with 1.0 being the file's default size).
* Repeats: uses the sequencer .repeats() method in order to generate the animation an additional number of times (as a count of repeats).
* Duration: uses the sequencer .duration() method in order to cap the duration of the animation and end it (in milliseconds).

#### Teleport
* Embed the teleport action into the lasting effect's tile. The location teleported to will be a second random location within the zone. Options provided follow this module's definitions for this action type with the following additions:
     * Twin: Creates a second tile at the teleport location that carries the same lasting effect settings as the first, but with a teleport location that points back to the first lasting effect. In  other words, the two new tiles will be paired and will teleport between each other.

### Token Says
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22696153/131543713-193c3cd2-9283-4dd5-85cd-86e1f67c87c4.png)
If installed, Token Says functionality is available for use utilizing that module's .saysDirect() method in the [API](https://github.com/napolitanod/Token-Says/blob/main/README.md). Any token targetted by a zone using a zone type with Token Says parameters set will invoke that token to say something.

### Warpgate
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22696153/131544351-5b8836d1-e3b0-4d7c-950b-43c7a8106818.png)
If installed, Warpgate will summon the given actor as a token to the location targetted by the zone that uses a zone type with this configured. You can summon either a specific actor each time or point to a rollable table in order to randomize the actor summoned.
* Delay: pause executing Warpgate for the amount of stated milliseconds after the zone triggers.
* Duplicates: Set the number of tokens to spawn to the targetted location, with the default being 1.
