# What Is Danger-Zone?
Bring danger, personality and life to your scenes. Danger Zone is a Foundary VTT module that provides GMs the ability to easily invoke localized effects within a scene. Examples of what you can do with this module:
* A storm where the danger of being struck by lightning is a deadly possibility.
* A crumbling building where the collapsing ceiling can injure or trap occupants.
* A twisted field of magic with portals that blink in and out of existance.
* A blessed glade offering healing to those who walk through.

## Getting Started

### 1. Create a Zone Type
The zone type is the lava bubble or vent of poisonous gas released from a lava field. It defines an effect that executes within a zone.

Add zone types by going to Foundry's 'Configure Settings' > 'Module Settings', locating Danger Zone, and selecting the 'Configure Danger Zone Types' button. See [Zone Types](../../wiki/Zone-Types) for more info.

### 2. Add Zone to Scene
The zone is the lava field. Within the zone's boundary tokens may be targetted and zone type effects generated.

Access the Danger Zone section from within scene configuration in order to create new zones. See [Zones](../../wiki/Zones) for more info.

### 3. Trigger Zone
The trigger causes the lava bubble to erupt from the lava field. A trigger can be invoked either manually or as part of a Foundary event.

See [Triggers](../../wiki/Triggers) for more info.

## Module Integration
Danger Zone integrates with a series of other Foundary modules in order to provide enhanced effects and token targetting. See the [Module Integration](../../Module-Integration) page for details on which modules extend Danger Zone base functionality if installed.
